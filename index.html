    <h1>jams by bike</h1>
</div>
      <h2>College town cruisin'</h2>
        <p>Urbana-Champaign is a Big 10 college town in Central Illinois; flat, beautiful grids as far as the bike could ride.</p>
        <p>My dad would gear up in spandex and he would ride with me on my 16 inch bike with training wheels along the shoulder of our rural route. </p>
        <p>Did Elizabeth Grow up in Iowa?</p>

        <input type="button" value = 'Yes' onclick="showNope()"/>
        <input type="button" value = 'No' onclick="showGreat()"/>

      <h2>When the rubber really hit the road</h2>

        <p> I was living in New York City teaching bicycle mechanics in schools and I moved to Portland in 2013 to be closer to my sister and her family. </p>
        <p>Before I worked at Airbnb, I had a working knowledge of Google Suite. I had no idea there was free food on my first day!</p>
        <p>Did Elizabeth move to Oregon in 2013?</p>

        <input type="button" value = 'Yes' onclick="showGreat()"/>
        <input type="button" value = 'No' onclick="showNope()"/>

      <h2>Diego and Elizabeth </h2>

        <p>My boyfriend's name is Diego. He's a CPA and works in the SOX office at PGE. We ride bikes into work together in the morning.
          He likes to code in Python and is endlessly curious about freight trains. </p>
        <p>We are both vegan, we laugh a lot and enjoy hanging out with our families. </p>
        <p>Does Diego like trains?</p>

          <input type="button" value = 'Yes' onclick="showGreat()"/>
          <input type="button" value = 'No' onclick="showNope()"/>

      <h2>The Food Team</h2>

        <p>On my first day of work I arrived with a pannier filled with second breakfast, snacks, lunch and a light dinner.</p>
        <p>Little did I know that there was a whole department focused on food! We have a restaurant that is on the next block and I have healthy, organic, local food options for every meal.</p>
        <p>How many meals do I eat at work?</p>


      <br />
        <input type="radio" name="number of meals" value="Snacks are my meals."
          checked="checked" onclick="showNope()" /> Snacks are my meals.
        <input type="radio" name="number of meals" value="Lunch only."
          checked="checked" onclick="showNope()" /> Lunch only.
        <input type="radio" name="number of meals" value="As many as humanly possible."
          checked="checked" onclick="showGreat()" /> As many as humanly possible.
        </br>


      <h2>~Peanut butter sandwiches and apple slices~</h2>

        <p>My favorite snack is an apple cut into slices with a spoonful of peanut butter on each slice.</p>
        <p>I spend a lot of time thinking about what I am going to eat. Food is so fun and delicious!</p>
        <p>But, does she eat honey?</p>

        <input type="button" value = 'Yes' onclick="showNope()"/>
        <input type="button" value = 'No' onclick="showGreat()"/>
